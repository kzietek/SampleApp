#  Purpose of this project

This project was created for sole purpose of showing my coding style in Swift, without violating any NDAs.

## The quality of project

Currently i've spent only a few hours on this skeleton app and I don't consider this the best I can do. I've seen better code and my aim is to code even better than that :-)

## Requirements

The project was created using XCode 9 Beta and may *not run on earlier versions*.

## TODO:
- Write example unit tests and make the code more testable
- Add snapshot tests
- Add Networking layer
- Add Persistence layer
- ...
